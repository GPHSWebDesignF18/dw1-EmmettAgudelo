  <h1>Marvels top 4 symbiotes least to strongest</h1>
</aside>
<section class="sectionRight">
  <h2>Symbiote #1: Venom</h2>
  <p>In the marvel universe venom was the first symbiote to enter the comics and now in the movies. The symbiotes are from the planet klyntar where the alien life forms require a host to live and become stronger. Venom is the weak link in the murdures bunch of symbiotes in the comics and movies. every symbiote gives off an offspring which are naturally stonger than their parents with much more capacity for strengh and new abilities that thier parents do not poses. Due to Venom being the first of the blood line of symbiotes he is by far the least strongest, Venoms abilities are camoflauge, Shapeshifting his body, healing factor, and unlimited webbing or tentrills. The most common reason why Venom still manages to defeat much stronger symbiotes is because the longer a symbiote lives the stronger they become. All symbiotes have an extreme threat, Sonic power and fire, but Venom due to his extent of life he becomes more amune to those weaknesses. First of the known blood line.</p>

  <h2>Symbiote #2: Riot</h2>
	<p>In the marvel universe Riot was a part of a gaurdian team with four other different symbiotes "Lasher, Scream, Phage, and Agony". Riot was the extremely violent symbiote and by far the strongest of the five, Riot was not apart of Venoms blood line he was the first same as Venom. In the movie "Venom" 2018 Riot was infact much stronger than Venom, this is infact true because Riot was the largest symbiote in the marvel universe and started with much more abilities than Venom ever possesed. Riots abilities were shapeshifting in to Different huminoid bodies, unlimited webbing, increasesed healing factor, and tentrill manipulation, so Riot was pretty much able to change his arms into axes or maces. Riot is also extremely weak against fire and sonic power like all symbiotes. First of a different blood line of symbiotes.</p>

	<h2>Symbiote #3: Carnage </h2>	
	<p>The marvel cenimatic univsese has just released the new "Venom" movie in 2018 giving away a sneak peak of Carnage, an extremely powerful symbiote and son of Venom. Carnage like any other offspring posseses more abilities and a greater immunity to fire and sonic power than their predassesor, Carnage has been known to kill and tourture parts of the city of Manhatten. Because Carnage is the son of Venom he gains instant abileties that his father "Venom" claims. Carnage has a varity of abilities such as camoflauge, shapeshifting, tentrill manipulation, a Carnage infestation, advanced healing factor, plus an incredibly strong bond with Carnages host creating more endurence. Carnage is extremely violent and wants to be better than any other symbiote in the marvel universe, when Carnage will have an offspring he will kill it because he knows that the offspring will be stronger than its predassesor.</p>   <img src="../Unnamed Site 2/Carnage dreamweeaver.jpg" width="254" height="172">
	<h2>Host is Cerial killer "Cletus Kasady" </h2>
	</section>
<section class="sectionRight">
  <h2>Symbiote #4: Toxin</h2>
	<p>Toxin is the offspring of Carnage, due to that fact Toxin will be much more powerful than Carnage. This fact is exactly why Carnage when Toxin was born wanted to kill him, but Venom which is Toxins grandfather protected Toxin until he joined with a host and could protect himself. Once Toxin joins with his host he dosen't control his host he obeys them and listens to their opinion of how to live with the symbiote. Toxins abilities are camoflauge, tentrill manipulation, Toxin infestatoin, superior healing factor compared to Carnage, unlimited webbing, and a venimous bite. Toxin is claimed to be the strongest symbiote of the Venom blood line and the entire bunch of symbiotes on earth in the marvel universe.</p>
